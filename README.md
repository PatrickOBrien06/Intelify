# Intelify
An app to generate a book of any given size about anything. 

## Instructions

By using the topic, chapter and subsection fields a user can make a book with any prompt. The book will be shown in a PDF file displayed in the HTML and with a download option.

## How it works

Using the GPT-API it asks the API to make an outline of the book shown in a python dictionary show the program can access it, like this '{"Chapter 1": ["Subchapter 1.1", "Subchapter 1.2", "Subchapter 1.3"]}'. Then, it loops through each Chapter in the python dictionary and finds each Subchapter within each Chapter and asks the API to generate the content of that subchapter. For each subchapter it adds the title and content to a DOCX file then converts the file to a PDF file to embed into the HTML.

## Development 

In my experience developing this, I learned a lot about AI, APIs and problem solving. One of the things with this project that look me a while to figure out was trying to find a way to convert the outline of the book to create each subchapter. I eventually came across the idea of getting CHAT-GPT to generate the outline in a python dictionary format. Then looping throught the values of each key in the dictionary. {"Chapter 1": ["Subchapter 1.1", "Subchapter 1.2"]}
